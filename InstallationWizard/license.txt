The software is not problem-free, and no user is infallible. Back up your data using Time Machine or any third-party backup utility.

Verifying startup disk:
Before running Maintenance or Cleaning tasks, you should check the S.M.A.R.T. status of the startup disk and its system files. 

These verifications are essential and errors in the structure of system files are not uncommon and can have disastrous consequences if they're not repaired.

Computer does not respond:
The software cannot destroy the System. 
If your computer does not respond during the verification of the volume by a third party software program, the software is not the cause. 
This may be expected and normal behavior! After the third party software program has finished checking, control should be returned to you.

Personal data removed:

You should observe certain basic rules regarding the file system. Mac OS X is a Unix-based operating system and has a well-defined structure. 
Your data must be stored in your HOME directory, in the existing folders (for example, "Documents", "Pictures", "Music", and so on, or in additional folders that you have previously created in your HOME directory). 
You should never store your documents or applications in folders that are subordinated to the operating system (for example, folders named "Library", "System", or in any of the subfolders of these folders). 

Back up your data regularly.

Problem with a hidden function:
The software will not always be able to correct a function that has an undesirable behavior. 

The functions were created by the developers of the System, the third party application or the operating system concerned. 
The software merely turns those functions on or off, using a simple command, if one of those functions causes a problem, it will be fixed in an upgrade by the developers or the third party application developers or by the OS.

You should always consider to update the software and your Operating System for security reasons.
